# Hybrid Search with Pinecone
## Overview
This repository demonstrates a hybrid search implementation using Pinecone. The hybrid search leverages both dense and sparse vector representations to enhance search results. This approach combines the strengths of dense embeddings (like those from neural networks) with sparse embeddings (such as those from traditional text representations) to improve search accuracy and relevance.
